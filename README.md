# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
This project demonstrates a complete workflow for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes two main components: a Jupyter Notebook for building and training a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a separate inference notebook to use the trained model for classifying new, user-provided images.
